Browsers provide a web worker that provides the functionality to do more than
one thing at the time

Web Workers is a isolated javascript env that runs alongside tha main program and can
comunicate with it only sending and receiving messages

"code/squareworker.js"
addEventListener("message", function(event) { //complicated stuff that take a lot of time
    postMessage(event.data * event.data);
}); 


var squareWorker = new Worker("code/squareworker.js");
squareWorker.addEventListener("message", function(event) {
    console.log("The worker responded:", event.data);
});
squareWorker.postMessage(10);
squareWorker.postMessage(24);
