whats the difference between class and prototypal inheritance
  Class
    Class is a blueprint of an object, it inherit from classes and create subclass relationship
    Class my or may not be instanciated via the 'new' and it may or may not use the class keyword from ecma6
    All classes are created using the constructor function


  Prototypal inheritance
    In prototypal inheritance, objects inherit directly from other objects
